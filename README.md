# CalcDown

CalcDown is a text-first format for “spreadsheet-like” models: typed data + a reactive compute graph + declarative views, designed to be friendly to AI editing and to Git diffs/merges.

## Docs

- `PURPOSE.md` — project goals and thesis
- `docs/calcdown-0.1.md` — draft file format + execution model
- `docs/stdlib-0.1.md` — draft standard library (`std.*`)
- `docs/examples/mortgage.calc.md` — end-to-end example

## Status

Early-stage: this repo currently contains draft specifications and examples, not a full implementation.
